<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create IB.GAMES, a series of web-native, mobile-first mini-games designed to teach investment banking concepts. The first game is Greenshoe Sprint — Stabilize the IPO.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Platform:** Mobile web (iOS Safari, Android Chrome).
- **Gameplay:** 60–120 seconds, replayable, one-thumb controls.
- **Pedagogy:** Learn by playing with post-run analysis, a Real World Story segment (using Alibaba's IPO as an example), and a glossary.
- **Game Core:** A Decision Beats system where the game pauses, giving the user a few seconds to choose an action (Add Supply, Add Demand, Do Nothing) with clear consequences.
- **Social:** A Share on LinkedIn feature with a dynamically generated Score Card image.
- **Art Style:** Neon Exchange — visually stunning, modern, with cinematic lighting and particle effects.
- **Landing Page:** A main landing page for IB.GAMES that features the Greenshoe Sprint game as a clickable tile, with other tiles showing Coming Soon for future games.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete frontend-only implementation of the Greenshoe Sprint game using React and the Phaser 3 game engine. The application features a main landing page for IB.GAMES, an animated pre-game explainer, the core decision-based gameplay, a detailed results screen, and audio effects. The game logic is driven by mock data and internal simulation within Phaser.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was implementing a large batch of user-requested fixes:
    1. Creating a new  landing page with a game tile system.
    2. Fixing inconsistent scoring logic, particularly ensuring the  score is calculated correctly and that no score can exceed its defined maximum.
    3. Increasing the decision timer in the game to 7 seconds.
    4. Improving the UI of the decision buttons to prevent text overflow and enhance their clickability.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The next agent must start by taking a screenshot to verify the new landing page, then navigate into the game to test the 7-second timer, the button UI, and the accuracy of the final scorecard after a full gameplay session.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**Completed work in this session**
- **Game Logic Refactor:** Transformed the gameplay from real-time reactive to a turn-based Decision Beats system to improve playability and educational value.
- **Onboarding Improvement:** Created and iterated on the  component to teach game concepts.
- **UI/UX and Scoring:** Significantly enhanced the UI with clearer labels, better feedback, and audio. Iteratively fixed and improved the scoring logic based on user feedback.
- **Landing Page:** Created the  component to serve as the main hub for the game series.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   This is covered in the **All Pending/In progress Issue list**. The key unfixed items are the broken explainer navigation and the unimplemented LinkedIn sharing feature.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS
- **Game Engine:** Phaser 3, integrated within a React application.
- **Architecture:** A frontend-only Single Page Application (SPA) using simulated data for game scenarios.

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (No database is currently in use).

**changes in tech stack**
-   Phaser 3 was introduced to build the interactive game component.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the core game logic, including the Decision Beats system, scoring, and Phaser scene setup.
-   : The new main entry point for the application.
-   : Displays the final score and performance breakdown.
-   : The pre-game tutorial component, which has a known navigation bug.
-   : Main router, now pointing to the landing page.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file has grown to over 1000 lines. It could be broken down into smaller, more focused modules (e.g., UI, Game Logic, Scenarios) to improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user has driven a major pivot from a fast-paced arcade game to a slower, educational, decision-based experience. Prioritize clarity and learning over speed.
-   You must first verify all the changes from the last session (landing page, 7s timer, scoring) are working as expected before moving on to other issues.
-   The broken navigation in the  is a recurring problem, likely caused by a  or layout issue with the Emergent badge. This needs a definitive fix.

**documents and test_reports created in this job**
-   None.
